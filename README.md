## Purpose
Have you ever had the weather ruin plans for a BBQ? Do you travel constantly and need to know what kind of clothes to pack? Do you want to avoid terrible drivers on the road? All these issue can be avoided by checking the **Weather Dashboard**. No more BBQ in the rain, no more bringing a swimsuit when it snows, and no more fender benders because a truck thought its 4wd would help it stop going 80 in a blizzard.

## Functionality
The weather dashboard allows you to search the weather in any city. The current weather in that city will display useful information such as: Date, temp, description, high & low, wind speed, and humidity. Also displayed is a five day forecast, so that you can plan ahead. The five day forecast displays the follow: Date, description, high, and humidity.

The weather dashboard also stores your history on the side bar. No more having to retype the city every time. Just click the button and the weather for that city will be displayed. Additionally, the last city searched will automatically be populated, so no more searching for your hometown.
